#Exercise for logical operators and if-elif statements
#Prompt the user for a fruit name
#Check if the fruit is a tropical or citrus fruit
#If the fruit is “mango” or “pineapple”, then print out “It’s a tropical fruit!”
#If the fruit is “orange” or “lemon”, then print out “It’s a citrus fruit!”
#HINT: use .lower() function when checking the fruit cases, example: fruit.lower()
