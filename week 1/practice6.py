#1. Write a line of code to assign a secret number to a variable, like this: secret_number = 7

#2. Print and display a welcoming message to the player. Write a line of code to print a message, for example: print("Welcome to the Guessing Game! Can you guess the secret number?")

#3. Set up a while loop to keep the game running until the player guesses the correct number. Write the initial line of the while loop, like this: while guess != secret_number:

#4. The guess variable will hold the player's guess, which starts with a value of 0 initially.

#5. The loop will continue as long as the player's guess is not equal to the secret number.

#6. Inside the while loop, ask the player to enter their guess. Write a line of code to prompt the player, like this: guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))

#7. The int() function is used to convert the input into a whole number.

#8. Add conditional statements to provide feedback based on the player's guess. Use if-elif-else statements. For example:

#9. If the guess is lower than the secret number, print "Too low! Try again."

#10. If the guess is higher than the secret number, print "Too high! Try again."

#11. If the guess is equal to the secret number, the loop will end.

#12. Step 7: After the while loop, write a line of code to print a congratulatory message for guessing the secret number correctly. For example: print("Congratulations! You guessed the secret number", secret_number, "correctly!")

#13. Step 8: Save the file with a descriptive name, run it, and play the guessing game!

#14. The program will prompt you to enter a guess and provide feedback until you guess the correct number.
