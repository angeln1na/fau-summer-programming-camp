#X input variable to enter a number
x=input("Enter a number:")
#Y input variable to enter a number
y=input("Enter a number:")
#A variable to calculate addition of both integer variables
addition = int(x)+int(y)
#Displaying Addition to the screen
print("Addition")
#Displaying "X + Y =" and returning the corresponding variable
print(x, "+", y, "=", addition)

# 1. Following the example continue with creating variables for subtraction, multiplication, division and square root
# 2. Add two more variables to input such as a and b calculate them separately as X and Y
