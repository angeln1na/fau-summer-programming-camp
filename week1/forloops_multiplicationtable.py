#Exercise for for loops
#Make a program that prints the multiplication table of a given number (1, 2, 3,...,10)
#Get the number from the user
#Print out a sentence saying what multiplication number will be used
#Use the for loop multiplying the given number by numbers 1 through 10 and printing each result
#HINT: range() will be useful, example: range(1,11)
#Print out each result in this format, for example: 5 x 1 = 5, 5 x 2 = 10, etc.,
